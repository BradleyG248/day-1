  <h1 class="red" id="yeah">About me</h1>
  <p class="blue" id="about">I'm just a high school graduate looking for ways to pay for college, so I'm hoping this
    will open some doors for me. I like the outdoors fine, although I don't spend very much time there. As I said
    earlier I enjoy video games, as well as most board or tabletop games, like D&D or Monopoly.</p>
